1. 

after changing UI, there are some chances that the name of the methods in Calculator.cs isnt accurate
(e.g. button1_click might be button9_click)

so, I adjusted them. I only need to modify and correct Calculator.cs and the variable initialization
in Calculator.Design.cs!


2. Operators seems working, I started to modify the clear part not the backspace. Dot or period seems working too
I need to start to find some bugs like dividing by zero.
