1. 

after changing UI, there are some chances that the name of the methods in Calculator.cs isnt accurate
(e.g. button1_click might be button9_click)

so, I adjusted them. I only need to modify and correct Calculator.cs and the variable initialization
in Calculator.Design.cs!


2. Operators seems working, I started to modify the clear part not the backspace. Dot or period seems working too
I need to start to find some bugs like dividing by zero. 


3. Start to focus on positive and negative numbers. I need to add a logic for that.
I also need to include how parenthesis works.

4. positive and negative symbol works now in any places, I only need to change what is the current number
after I click an operator.
